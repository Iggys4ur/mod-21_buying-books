# [Module 3] JavaScript: Employee Payroll Tracker

## What I Learned From This Project

This project involved creating a payroll management application using JavaScript, which dynamically updates HTML and CSS. The project provided practice in handling user inputs, manipulating data structures, and implementing core JavaScript functionalities such as loops and conditionals. Additionally, it reinforced the importance of a responsive user interface that adapts to different screen sizes.

# Project Overview

The Employee Payroll Tracker application enables payroll managers to view and manage employee payroll data. The application runs in the browser and features a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

## Details

The project requirements were:

- **Creating a dynamic user interface** using JavaScript
- **Handling user inputs** to add employee data
- **Displaying and sorting employee data** based on user interactions
- **Logging aggregated data** to the console
